================================ 1 | Starting the container | ================================

The command used for starting the container:

docker run -p 30000:30000 yondermakers/yonder-devops-tech-assessment-arm-cpu:latest --server.port=30000

Useful resource: https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker

================================ 1.5 | Snooping around | ================================

Did some snooping around in the container itself and on the web page looking for some easter
eggs maybe? Didn't really find anything interesting.

================================ 3 | The console application | ================================

1. Tried the route for the licenses inside a browser to see how they look like
2. Tested the length parameter for 150 licenses and it works
3. Tried to think about the general layout of my app.
- I will need a class to handle the api connection. this class should get the licenses
and also validate the json and the types in case the data from the api "will ever change"
- I will need a class for the filters
- I will need a class for exporting to excel
4. Implemented the api class and decided it will be a good idea to add a config.json and a
config class for easily changing the url for the api and changing the folder for exporting
excel files
5. Implemented the config reader and config.json
6. Implemented the filters and tested them
7. Implemented the exporting for excel functionality
8. made a simple cli in main.py as 4 print statments don't really need a separate class
9. made requirments.txt for easily running the project
